 Logs monitoring in K8S
 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 -> Real time Log monitoring is done by EKF and Splunk
 -> Splunk has licence to access so we cannot setup in our System now so we are using EKF

 If application is running on K8S then how to get the log messages of our application
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 note: as a developer we dont have access to on K8S cluster we caanot use this cmd directly  in real time 
       develops people can use this cmd directlyto get log messages
       developer people uses EFK tool to get log messages from K8S ( elasticsearch Kibana filesearch) 

 kubectl get pods -o wide  => to get node ( beacuse every application is deploy as pod application)

 kubectl logs <node_name>  => to get logs msg

 But why Log messages required 
 ------------------------------
  -> If application have any problem then that problem we trouble shooting using log messages
 
 
 EFK Stack setup
 +++++++++++
 -> EFK Stack setup will do by Devops people then will provide us the Kibana Url to access the logs messages
 -> EFK stack is the Combination of open source 3 products
 -> E -> Elastic Search
    F -> File Bean / Fluent D
    K -> Kibana
 -> THis EKF stack will provide centralized logging in order to identify problems with servers or applications
 -> It allows you to search all the logs in a single place

 => Fluent D is responsible to collect logs from PODS and store into Elastic Seacrh
 => Elastic search is like log database , in which logs will be stored and it will index logs for faster retrival 
 => Kibana is a web application which provide user interface to fetech logs from Elastic search

Note: 
 -> With the help of K8S we are not deploy the application on Production only , we deploy the application on every enviorment 
 -> like Developer , testing , production etc
 -> Each enviorment has any problem then we can found it by log messages
 -> Each Enviorment has its seperate Kibana URL
 -> Testing env have any problem then solve it , check there log messages and solve it .


=> How to delete all the pods , services, deployment from CLuster 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 using cmd : kubectl delete all --all

 delete all namespace(package) then all tools you install they are delete
      cmd : kubectl delete ns efklog
          this cmd delete all the names in the namespcae 

 cmd to delete cluster: eksctl delete cluster --name <cluster_name> --region ap-south 1

 WHat is difference between microservices Load balancer and K8S load balancer
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Microservices Laod Balancer : client side load balancer
 K8S Load balancer           : service side Load balancer
