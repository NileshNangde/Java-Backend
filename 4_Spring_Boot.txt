Spring Boot      spring boot 2.1.0 -  2017  
                 Spring 5.1.2 is compatible version for spring boot 2.0.1 
                 Spring data JPA added in this Spring Boot Version
------------

1) Explain the Architecture of Spring boot
  ----------------------------------------
  -> SPring boot application we develop into different layers 
  ->

                            COntains Business Logic                        Contains Persistance Logic 
                          DTO class       |                                            |
FrontEnd <= Controller Layer   |    Service Layer        Respository Layer        DAO Layer   => DB

1) What is Spring Boot framework and what are the  main features of spring boot FW
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 -> Spring boot is another way to develop spring based applications with auto configuration , POM starter , Embeded server and Actuators and due to this  rapid development
    of the application can be possible .
 -> Auto configuration means  
     - Starting IOC container automatically
    - Creating Connection Pool
    - Creation SMTP Connections
    - Web Application Deployment to server
    - Depedency Injections etc....
    - Annotattions supports
 -> POM stater means nothing but dependencies that we use to develop our application
    - web-starter
    - jdbc-starter
    - security-starter
    - mail-starter
 -> Embeded Servers  - provide web server to run our web applications
    - Tomcat (default)
    - Jetty
    - Netty
 > Actuators are used to monitor and manage our application. Actuators providing production-ready features for our application.
    a) How many classes loaded
    b) how many objects created
    c) how many threads are running
    d) URL Mappings Available
    e) Health of the project etc...
-> Rapid Development means fast development. We can focus only on business logic because Boot will take care of configurations.



 2) Difference between Spring and Spring Boot FW
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   80 % spring and spring boot FW are same only difference are 

   point 1 : Spring support Monolitic Architecture                    SB support microserives architecture

   point 2 : In spring FW we have to configure the                   in SB FW there is auto configuration concept 
             dependicies manually                                     through which depencies are automatically configured based in requiredment

   point 3 : In spring we have to manually deploy the project         SB supports internally embeded server like tomcat , jetty etc
             on server , for that all setup we have to do manually 

   point 4 : spring have lot of compatibility issues                   no compatability issues
            compatabality issues means for this version this 
            jar files requried

   point 5 : due to lot of configuration issues  developer head ache is there so they develop SB


 3) Explain the project structure of spring boot application
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> WHen ever we create the Spring boot application the first there is one root folder is create 
    -> that root folder is our project Name - 09-Spring-Boot-App  -------------- Project Name (root folder)
    -> In this root folder there are 6 sub folders 
    -> 3 related to src folder and next 3 related to 1 is maven dependencies folder ,2 is target folder , 3rd is pom.xml
    -> src/main/java       which contains - Application.java   (This is start class) (Application starts from here ,just right click and start)
                           We will write our source code under src/main/java folder
    -> src/main/resources  which contains - application.properties or application.yml  (All configuration related properties add here )
                           We will create our configuration files under src/main/resources folder
    -> src/test/java       which contains - ApplicationTests.java
                           We will create Junit class under src/test/java folder
    -> Maven Dependencies   (It contains jars which got downloaded for project)
    -> target             (it contains .class files)
    -> pom.xml            (All Maven dependicies configuration file)
                          Project dependencies we will configure in pom.xml file


 4) Expalin what is start class in Spring Boot? and explain internals of run() method
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> Start class means every spring boot applciation is executed form this start class 
    -> When we create any spring boot application the one defaut Application.java file is created this is start class 
    -> And in this start class two main functionalities are available 1 is class is annotated with @SpringBootApplication
       and 2nd is run() method
      @SpringBootApplication
      public class Application {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
          }
      }
    -> @SpringBootApplication is equals to 3 annotation i.e @ Configuration , @EnableAutoConfiguration , @ComponentScan
    -> And run (..) method which contains bootstrapping logic. 
    -> Bootstrapping logic means the logic required to execute the Spring boot application and it contains 
            - start and stop watch
            - start listners
            - prepareEnv
            - print Banner
            - create IOC container
            - refresh Container
            - stop that stop watch
            - print time taken to start application
            - call runners
            - return IOC reference

 5) Explain How IOC container will start in Spring Boot ?
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> In spring boot application the run() method will be execute the IOC container based on the dependency we added to create the application
    -> For spring boot-starter, run( ) method using "AnnotationConfigApplicationContext" class to start IOC container
    -> For spring boot-starter-web, run ( ) method using "AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext" to start IOC
    -> For starter-webflux, run ( ) method using "AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext" to start IOC
    -> spring boot-starter is used to create standalone applications
    -> spring boot-starter-web dependency is used to develop web applications
    -> spring boot-starter-webflux is dependency is used to develop applications with Reactive Programming

 6) Explain what is  Runners in Spring Boot
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> When we deploy the application on server and only once we want to execute any logic if this requirement is there then we use runner concept
    -> Runners are getting called at the end of run ( ) method
    -> To implement Runner in SB application They given 2 inteface
         1) ApplicationRunner inteface 
         2) CommandLineRunner inteface
    -> Both runners are functional interface. They have only one abstract method i.e run (..) method
    -> Use cases
      ---------------
      1) send email to management once application started
      2) read data from db tables and store into cache memory

      @Component
      public class CacheManager implements ApplicationRunner {

          @Override
          public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
              System.out.println("Logic executing to load data into cache....");
          }
      }

      @Component
      public class SendAppStartMail implements CommandLineRunner {

          @Override
          public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
              System.out.println("logic executing to send email....");
          }
      }

 
 7) Explain @SpringBootApplication annotation
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> This annotation is used with start class of the spring boot application
    -> This annotation is equals to 3 annotations 
       1) @SpringBootConfiguration
       2) @EnableAutoConfiguration
       3) @ComponentScan
    -> Without this annotation we cannot start our application

 8) What is Banner in Spring Boot
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    -> While execution of the spring boot application in console we see the spring logo that is called as Banner in Spring boot
    -> We can customize that banner also  by creating "banner.txt" file under src/main/resources
    -> We can keep our company name or project name as Banner text in Ascii format
    -> Note: Generate Ascii text from here : https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Ashok%20IT
    -> Spring Boot banner having below 3 modes
    1) console  ---- > it is default mode
    2) log
    3) off
    -> Note: If we set banner mode as off then banner will not printed
       spring.main.banner-mode = off
