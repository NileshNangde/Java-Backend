	1) What is Spring Web MVC
	   ++++++++++++++++++++++
	   -> Spring Web MVC is one module in Spring Framework to develop web applications.
       -> And with the help of this Web MVC module web application development process is more simplified .
	   -> To develop web application using spring-boot we need to add ### spring-boot-starter-web ### starter in pom.xml	
	   -> The above starter provides support for below things
		1) MVC based web applications
		2) RESTFul Services
		3) Embedded Container (Tomcat)

	2) Web Application vs. Distributed Application
	   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
              Web Application
             ------------------
       -> A web application is an application that is accessed all 
          over Internet .It uses a web browser as a client. 

	4) Spring Web MVC Architecture
	   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	   -> MVC design pattern is divided into 6 parts 
	   -> 1) DispatcherServlet 2) Handler Mapper 3) Controller 4) ModelAndView 5) ViewResolver 6) View
	   -> DispatcherServlet :- This act as the Front Controller.
                               And it is Responsible to perform Pre-Processing and Post-Processing of Http request
       -> Handler Mapper    :- After pre-processing of the request Dispatcher servelet send request to hander mapper
                               Handler Mapper is going to identify the controller method and map the http request to that controller class method
                               And again send response to Dispatcher servlet that the controller class method is available
       
	   -> Controller        :- After Dispatcher servlet knows that in controller class request method is available then 
	                           Dispatcher servlet send http request to that Controller 
	                           Controller is one Java class which is responsible to handle the main request & response
		                       This class is going to be execute the logic by loading  controller -> service -> dto classes and return data and file logical name
                               This Controller will be return the data in ModelAndView object format to DispatcherServlet.
							   Model: Represents data in key-value format
							   View: Logical File Name
		                      Note: Controllers are loosely coupled with Presentation technology ex( jsp , thymeleaf).
		 
	   -> ViewResolver: To identify presentation file location and technology( where is that view file and what technology is means JSP , thymeleaf)
	   -> View: It is responsible to render Model data in view file.
   
    5) What is mean by Embedded database or H2 DataBase
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       -> H2 Data base is one embedded database , embedded database means one temporary database
       -> And this H2 database is one example id embedded data base
       -> When application starts this H2 DB will start. When application stopped database will be stopped.
       -> Note: Embedded Databases are used for Proof Of Concept (POC) development.

    6) How to use Embedded DB in Spring Boot
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       -> Add H2 dependency in pom.xml file
           <dependency>
               <groupId> com.h2database </groupId>
               <artifactId> h2</artifactId>
               <scope> runtime </scope>
           </dependency>

       -> Configure H2 DB properties in application.properties file
          spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
          spring.datasource.username=abc
          spring.datasource.password=abc
          spring.datasource.driver-class-name
 
       -> Once application started we can access H2 DB console using below URL
          localhost:8080/h2-console/
    
    7) How to change Embedded Container from Tomcat to Jetty?
       ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       -> first of all in <exclusions> tag in pom.xml we need to add the tomcat dependency 
       -> exclusion means remove 
       -> then add jetty dn dependency in pom.xml

    8) How to change Embedded Container Port Number?
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       -> server.port=9090

    9) How to handle Exception handling in spring boot application
       +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       -> In Spring Boot we can handle exceptions in below 2 ways
		  1) Local Exception Handling (Controller Specific)
		  2) Global Exception Handling (Application specific)

    10) What is differnce between  @Controller & @RestController?
